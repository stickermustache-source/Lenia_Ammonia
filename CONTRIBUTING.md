# How to Contribute to Lenia Ammonia

Thank you so much for your interest in this project!

If you'd like to help, here are several ways you can get involved:

## 1. Reporting a Bug or Suggesting an Idea

The easiest way to contribute is to provide feedback.

* **Report a Bug:** Did you find strange behavior? Did the application crash?
* **Suggest an Enhancement:** Do you have a great idea for a new environment, a new behavior, or a new Lenia creature?

For both of these cases, please open an **[Issue](https://github.com/stickermustache-source/Lenia_Ammonia/issues)**.

Please try to be as descriptive as possible:
* For a bug, describe the steps to reproduce it.
* For an idea, explain the concept and why you think it would be interesting.

## 2. Proposing a Code Change (Pull Request)

If you'd like to fix a bug or implement a new feature yourself, here is the recommended workflow:

1.  **Fork** the repository (click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner).
2.  **Create a branch** for your change (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-idea`).
3.  **Code** your modification.
4.  **Send a Pull Request** (PR) from your branch to this repository's `main` branch.

I will review your PR as soon as possible!
